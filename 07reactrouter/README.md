# React + Vite + react router concept

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
REACT ROUTER
React Router is a popular routing library for React applications. It enables navigation and dynamic rendering of components based on the URL. React Router helps in building single-page applications with multiple views.

Key Features:
Declarative Routing: Define routes using JSX syntax, making it easy to understand and maintain the routing structure.
Nested Routing: Nest routes within each other to create complex layouts and nested views.
Dynamic Routing: Handle dynamic route parameters to render components based on dynamic data.
Navigation: Navigate between views programmatically using history manipulation or declarative navigation components.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
